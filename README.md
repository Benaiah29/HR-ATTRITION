I'm thriled to share my very first dashboard, created with Excel.  i had the opportunity to work on a hypothetical HR attrition dataset with the incredible guidance o my instructor Favour Atane. i love the idea of diving into the data and bringing insights to life with this dashboard and i hope you ind it as interesting as i did working on it. A big thank you to @Waveacademics for this wonderful opportunity.  looking otward to doing more in the real-world data analytics space. let me know if you have any questions or eedback i'd love to hear your thoughts and keep learning.
